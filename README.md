# Suggesty-app


### Installation


To install, download and install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html) for your platform, then download and install [VirtualBox](http://virtualbox.org/).

Once Vagrant and VirtualBox are installed, you can download the latest release of this GitHub repo, and unzip it. `cd` into the unzipped folder and run:

```bash
$ vagrant up
$ vagrant ssh
```

The username for vagrant is `vagrant` and the password is `vagrant`. 

This will download and install the image, and then go through the dependencies and install them one by one. `vagrant ssh` will connect you to the image and give you a bash prompt. Once everything completes, you'll have a working box to build your apps on Android.

### Connected Android Devices

The image also has support for connected USB Android devices. To test whether devices are connected, you can run (from the box):

```bash
$ sudo /home/vagrant/android-sdk-linux/platform-tools/adb devices
```

If that does not work, or shows `????? permissions`, then run:

```bash
sudo /home/vagrant/android-sdk-linux/platform-tools/adb kill-server
sudo /home/vagrant/android-sdk-linux/platform-tools/adb start-server
```

Coming to a phone near you!

### Running the server

```bash
$ cd /vagrant/suggesty
$ ionic serve
```

The app will be available on `http://localhost:8100/` in the host env.
